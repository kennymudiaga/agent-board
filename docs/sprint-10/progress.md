## Verification record

- **Kickoff (producer-1, 2026-10-05):** wake-up feature live-tested on
  `sprint-10` (5 probes + organic mail: agent/role addressing fire, role
  filter + wake-loop guard silent, never-claims — all messages stayed
  `pending` until producer pickup, `attempts:1`). Dogfood findings filed:
  #109 (bootstrap `as <role>` clobbers workspace identity — reproduced at
  kickoff, dev-1 contributed via board note) and #110 (win32 `--exec`
  multi-word quoting gap). Sprint-9 non-blocking follow-ups carried in
  (T2): `AB_WAKE_RESOLVE_MS` NaN, `--log` ENOENT. Plan approved by human;
  T1 + T2 dispatched 2026-10-05.
